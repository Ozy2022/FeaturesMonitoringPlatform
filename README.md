A MERN-based web application called FMP (Feature Monitoring Platform) includes authentication, pagination, and comments to carry user requests and interest
to developers. Users, developers, or companies can create their own account and follow specific procedures to achieve the system's purpose. Users can submit a feature suggestion and
communicate with other users. Other users can see the request, vote for it as a like feature, and chat with each other to express their ideas. Developers and companies have similar
practical steps that enable them to see requests and respond to users.

3-MainHomPage_For_Request_View_post & Request_Features_page

This section describes the homepage of the web_app that enables users to communicate positively and verify views on any idea proposed by them. The left side of the page has three functions: feature request, feature title search, and feature tag search. The users can search for any title or tags for the registered features and quickly obtain all requests for that specific hashtag or title of the request. On the other side of the page, there is a feature request that requires the user to enter a title, message, hashtag, and image. After completing the form, the request will be displayed in the middle of the page. Users can like, comment, delete or modify the request. Users cannot modify or delete requests made by other users. To modify a request, the user needs to click on the three dots shown at the top of the request, and all the request information will move to the form on the left side, then the user can modify it and send it again.

##Future enhancements

The web application currently offers satisfactory services for all users. However, the developers aim to enhance the app's capabilities in the future by extending its services to developers. This will allow for greater feedback from users on how features can be developed or improved for specific apps, whether on iOS or Android platforms. The developers believe that this will result in an app that is more efficient and capable of achieving diverse objectives. Moreover, the developer aims to create a shapely layout design to introduce the web app in an interesting way to the stakeholders.
